/**
 * Structure for storing data of 1 event consisting of 5 32bit words.
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Usage:
 * Used by TBDecoder object to store data.
 * Memory is allocated on the heap for an array of EventData structs.
 * All data in input file is then saved at one time to the eventData array.
 * Data can then be accessed in the following format: eventArray[N].eventNumber
 * -----------------------------------------
 * Note:
 * In current application, raw data is initially stored, processed, and
 * re-stored in a more readable format using a helper function.

/** Union for accessing any byte of 4 byte word.
 * 	--------------------------------------------

* 	- declare union and set value using fullWord member.
* 	- access individual bytes by calling quartWord with desired index.
