This folder captures my ongoing work in Professor Nepomuk Otte's research group at Georgia Tech. We are working to develop
a high altituded Chrenkov telescope, the first of its kind. I am helping the project by coding the flight computer. The
flight computer processes data from. Various hardware inputs to piece together a detection event.

  * TBDecoder.cpp is a class which processes binary data produced by the TriggerBoard, a device which provides data about the time and general
    location of events.
  * PixelMapDecoder.cpp is a collection of functions which can be used to relate relavent parametes stored in the csv Pixel_Map.csv
  * EventBuilderReformatted.cpp is the main class of this project. It takes data from the TriggerBoard, by using TBDecoder.cpp, and from
    another device, the CoBo, to write events in the ROOT data format. These events will later be processed to determine priority for
    transmission to the ground.
