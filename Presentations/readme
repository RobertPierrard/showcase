Here you will find the materials I used in my poster and PowerPoint presentations at the end of
my work this past summer in the 2021 Vanderbilt Physics and Astronomy REU program.

Final_Poster_Presentation_Pierrard:
    This was for the poster presentation. The target audience was someone with a minor background
    in physics. As such, there are great simplifications in terminology. You can see the final
    figures we produced for our calculated charged particle nuclear modification factor.
    
RAA_Presentation:
    This is for the PowerPoint presentation. Unfortunately, I can not find the completed document.
    Nevertheless, you can see our figures for the pT spectra of various centrality collisions on
    slide 9, and our incomplete figures (not enough data) for the nuclear modifaction factor on 
    slide 10.
