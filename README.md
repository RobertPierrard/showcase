Hello!

My name is Robert Pierrard, I am a senior at Georgia Tech studying applied physics. I am currently applying to various PhD programs and I am using this space to demonstrate my work as an undergraduate researcher.

If you are from an admissions department, I hope you can see the care put into my work to produce quality results and reports. It is my personal obligation to thoroughly understand my work and I strive to effectively communicate that through my writing.

For my code, I hope you find it well organized and that it shows proficiency in various CS concepts.

Note: Two of the projects in this repository are incomplete. I work in two different research labs, the code for which can be found in the labBagheri and labShengquan folders.

Best Regards,

Robert
