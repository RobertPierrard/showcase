Hello!

My name is Robert Pierrard, I am a senior at Georgia Tech studying applied physics. I am currently applying to various PhD programs and I am using this space to demonstrate my work as an undergraduate researcher.

If you are from an admissions department, I hope you can see the care put into my work to produce quality results and reports. It is my personal obligation to thoroughly understand my work and I strive to effectively communicate that through my writing.

For my code, I hope you find it well organized and that it shows proficiency in various CS concepts.

Note: Two of the folder in this repository are incomplete becuase they show my ongoing research, which is incomplete. Both folders (labBagheri and labShengquan) are still indicative of my work.

Best Regards,

Robert
