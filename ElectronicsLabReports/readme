Here you will find three lab reports which I completed for two different Electronics Lab Courses at Georgia Tech.
These two courses, which account for a total of 10 credit hours, cover the following topics:
  * Physics of current flows through wire/materials
  * Physics of diodes, PN junctions, transistors, etc.
  * Logic gates/digital circuits - eventually building simple components of a computer/microcontroller.
  * Microcontroller programming and intro to FPGAs
  * Signal analysis, measurement processes in physics, and error propogation through circuits.
  
These labs are not intended to be rigorous reports. Rather they document my work as a I go through each lab,
which are designed for learning.

I have included only a few labs from these courses:

BoltzmannsConstant:
    Use simulation and experiment to analyze the propogation of Johnson noise through a specific circuit. By
    measuring this circuit we are able to calculate Boltzmann's constant. I am accurate within 1%.
    
FMTransmitterWriteUp:
    This was a final project for the first electronics course. I build an FM transmitter for which I can connect
    an audio jack and play music through a nearby radio. I did not design the circuit myself, but analyzed each
    of its components.
    
MicrocontrollerInterrupts:
    Demonstrates my experience with working with low level programming. While I used an Arduino, I did
    not take the luxury of coding in the Arduino format. Rather, I directly programmed the ATMegga328p
    microcontroller on-board the Arduino. Serious consideration regarding memory, time complexity, and the data
    path were made. As such I heavily referenced the ATMegga328p datasheet.
    
PID_Controller:
    Conceptual continuation of MicrocontrollerInterrups lab above. Using a mix of direct microcontroller
    programming and Arduino programming styles I design and implement a PD controller to maintain the frequency
    of a DC motor at any desired (achievable) setpoint value.
