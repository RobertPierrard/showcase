Here you will find three lab reports which I completed for PHYS 4321, Advanced Lab, at Georgia Tech.
The purpose of this course is to reproduce several historical experiments and gain experience in
writing lab reports.

These three labs demonstrate my strength as a scientic writer and an effective communicator.

Double_Slit_Lab:
    Reproduced the famous double slit experiment in the single photon limit and analyze several
    other diffractive patterns. Demonstrate the wave-particle duality of light.
    
Electron_Lab:
    Use Helmholtz coils and an electron gun to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio of the electron.
    Further investigate the diffractive patterns produced when electrons are fired at gold foil.
    
Hall_Effect_Lab_Report:
    Map the magnetic field of a large magnet and use a Hall sensor to measure the deflection of
    electrons when passing through the field. Unsuccessful in determining the charge of the
    electron, we do not know the current directions of our devices.
